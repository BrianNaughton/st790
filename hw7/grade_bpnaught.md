### Report preparation, use of git, and reproducibility: 10/10

* Is the homework submitted timely? Note submission time is defined as the git tagging time.
- Yes

* Is the report in pdf or html? 
- Yes

* Is the report prepared by RMarkdown/IPython or Sweave/LaTex? Handwritten report is not accepted.
- Yes

* Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)?
- Yes

* Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?   
- Yes

* Are there enough commits esp. in the `develop` branch? Are commit messages clear?
- Yes

* Is the submission tagged? HW submission time is according to tag time.
- Yes

* Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly?
- Yes

* Are there sufficient materials (files and instructions) provided in the `master` branch for reproducing all the results?
- Yes

* Are there clear instructions, either in report and in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?
- Yes
