This Rmarkdown file investigates the computational speed of Geweke's algorithm for sampling from a truncated univariate standard normal distribution. The regions were chosen to be compared with those sampled from the `TruncatedMVN.jl` package.  

```{r}
sessionInfo()
set.seed(327)
```
 - Region: $[-1.0, 2.0]:$
```{r}
library(truncnorm)
system.time(rtruncnorm(100000, -1.0, 2, 0, 1))
```
 - Region: $[0.2, 3.0]:$
```{r}
system.time(rtruncnorm(100000, 0.2, 3, 0, 1))
```
 - Region: $[-1.0, 1.0]:$
```{r}
system.time(rtruncnorm(100000, -1, 1, 0, 1))
```
 - Region: $[1.0, 5.0]:$
```{r}
system.time(rtruncnorm(100000, 1, 5, 0, 1))

```
